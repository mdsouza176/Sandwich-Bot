# Sandwich-Bot
This is a simple Sandwich Bot for creating sandwiches based on given options, which can be run on discord.

Prequisites to using Bot:

1. Have discrod account and then create bot using: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
2. In the process of creating a bot, you get a token which can be generated (!Very-Important, Don't show your token to anyone or they can
access your bot!). Keep a copy of that token.

3. Have a python IDE with python 3 installed (I can only gurantee that python 3.6.6 works and for me 3.7 didn't).

4. Install python package for dsicord, videos are online for how to use pip to install it (If you find that pip does not work,
try setting the path for the pip.exe in your PC's environment variables, again check online videos).

4. Open the sandwich.py file in the IDE and add your token where it says token in the file (Should be at the very bottom).

5. After your bot has been created through the URL given in step 1 and added to a server of your choice (Be considerate, don't disturb others
servers with your bot), run the sandwich.py file on your IDE and you will see bot running.

6. use the !sub command to play the sandwhich creation game.
